    <h2>Ingredients List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Rib-eye steak</li>
        <li>Salted butter</li>
        <li>Rosemary</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>

            <li>This is one of those tricks that takes minimal effort but works exceptionally well. Place a sprig of rosemary in the pan with your steak. After the flip, use your tongs to grab the rosemary and mop up the pan juices. Brush it over the steak to infuse each bite with flavorful rosemary oil. By the way, here’s how to cook medium-rare steak the right way.</li>
            <li>Many steakhouses make their product taste better by topping it with butter. It works even better if you flavor the butter first. Roasted garlic butter is fantastic, but we also love the more unique combinations that include things like blue cheese. Check out these easy flavored butter recipes to get inspired.</li>
            <li>Don’t feel like you have to go to the store and buy a premade steak rub. Making spice blends at home allows you to control the salt levels and ingredients—many store-bought rubs contain MSG. The simplest steak rub is salt, black pepper, garlic powder and onion powder, but have some fun with recipes like espresso steak rub.</li>
