    <h2>Ingredients List</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 small onion, grated</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional) </li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>

            <li>Super simple to do – you’re going to toss your sliced onions with cornstarch and salt, deep fry them in oil (vegetable, canola, or sunflower oil is great for this), and then set aside the fried onions to dry on a paper towel. Set aside the oil used for cooking the onions, as you’ll be using it again to make the tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Heat some of the oil you set aside earlier with garlic over medium heat in a saucepan or small pot. Be careful not to burn your garlic (I crush mine, but minced garlic works too!), this is just the first step. Next, add the remaining ingredients, bring to a boil, reduce your heat to medium low, cover, and allow to simmer for fifteen minutes.</li>
            <li>From there, it's just an assembly job. A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat, add the remaining reserved oil and fried onions (you can set some aside to use as a topping), lentils, alongside a tablespoon of salt (because seasoning is good). Stir, add four cups of water and bring to boil, maintaining for ten to fifteen minutes (or until your lentils have cooked through).

                Without draining, stir in rice, vermicelli, two cups of hot water, one more tablespoon or salt (because, seasoning!) and ground cumin. Bring the mixture to boil, reduce heat and simmer for twelve to fifteen minutes (or until the pasta is cooked). Fluff with a spoon or fork.
